    <p>Last year we obtained a sponsorship through the Secretary of Economic Development to travel to Boston with all the expenses paid. We must emphasize the support of the secretary of economy Dr. Rolando Zubirán Robert, whose was crucial to get this financial aid. </p>
    <p>Thanks in general to all the team lead by Gov. Rodrigo Medina for their kind contribution which covered most of the necessary travel expenses for the team members, and for the continuing support of the project. </p>

        <p>For this project we were positioned under the scheme of this chair to administrate our funding and role in the school. The students chair (i4) is a opportunity offered by the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, through its School of Biotechnology and Health Sciences, to students interested in biotechnology and food industries develop projects in the area. The concept is based on four core values:</p>
        <ol> 
        <li>Imagine.</li>
        <li>Investigate.</li>
        <li>Innovate.</li>
        <li>Incubate.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Student teams, like ours, that want to apply your project may reach hatching their own business, running an article in scientific research, process your patent application and compete internationally. We are specally grateful with them for their generous sponsorship, that allowed us to get the genes and some material for the project.</p>
