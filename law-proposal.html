		iGEM Tec de Monterrey has participated 5 consecutive years in the competition, so we have some experience regarding shipments of DNA across the border, material, laboratory kits, etc. Although Monterrey is only two hours away from the US border, every year we have had problems at customs when crossing this kind of material.
		</p>
		<p> 
		After a review of the Mexican customs Act we realized that there is no specific legislation regarding DNA material and as a consequence each customs office in the country acts differently towards this issue. Having just a few months for the realization of our projects, this can represent a huge setback for Mexican iGEM teams.
		</p>
		<p> 
		That’s why iGEM Tec de Monterrey together with fellow mexican iGEMers Virtus Parva, Biosint México, Genetix Tec CEM and iGEM Guadalajara decided to join forces to try to solve this issue. The purpose was to contact a lawyer who could help us to draft a law proposal for later delivery to a local Congresman who would be responsible for endorsing it to the local congress.
		</p>
		<p> 
		All the teams were involved in the drafting of the law; we shared our ideas and experiences in order to propose a law as complete and useful as possible. After this, we had a feedback session with the lawyers Dr. Donato Cárdenas and Eloisa Fernández who helped us to take the proposal to its final form. They also showed their compromise to support us in all the legal procedure. The next step was to contact a Congressman of our state (Nuevo León), who would be the responsible for endorsing the proposal to the local congress. This was done by all the teams, giving a total of 5 states of the nation processing the law proposal in their local congress.
		</p>
		<p> 
		The process is currently in its due course, but, giving its nature, is long and slow. It has been challenging to share our concerns and ideas with the lawyers and the Congressman because they have no background in science. The fear of the unknown is latent and we think that’s the reason why no one had attended this issue before.
		</p>
		<p> 
		We think that it is our duty to raise awareness among people to implement in a better way the new technologies. A major challenge of our country in order to get into the first world is to improve its scientific performance, that’s why actions like this are very valuable for all the population but specially to the scientific community and some high tech industries. The process is currently in course in 5 states; we hope this effort made by the Mexican iGEMers is appreciated and imitated by all the scientific community in México, we have 27 states left where the process could be initiated by them.
		</p>
		<p> 
		This project is not over yet, the process is hard and long because of the bureaucracy and steps it requires, but we are committed to follow this law until the end and we hope sometime soon this initiative will be executed in the Federal Regulatory Improvement Comission, and in a nearby future, Mexican iGEM teams and laboratories across the country will have no further problems regarding the biological material they receive.
