    <p>Dr. Cardineau began his career in the field of Agricultural Biotechnology in 1983 as a Scientist at a small start-up company, Sungene Technologies, where he also served a short time as Manager of Market Development. He moved and then Director of Molecular Biology.
He has 28 issued US patents and 19 published applications and over 140 patent and application worldwide. These works include; broad enabling patents describing the earliest production of vaccines in transgenic plants, the synthesis of genes to improve their expression in a foreign host and the only plant made vaccines approved by a regulatory authority for commercial release. We thank him for his kind support to get the project going, as well as all his advices, his narration for the video and all the material that he kindly gave us.</p>

    <p>Richard Willson's laboratory works on biomolecular recognition, and its applications in separations and molecular diagnostics. He is interested in the structural determinants of molecular recognition in complexes of proteins with recognition agents such as monoclonal antibodies and aptamers. He is on the editorial board of several peer-reviewed journals and continuously mentors and trains undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. Prof. Willson has been co-founder of three companies based on technology developed in academic institutions, and has 15 patents licensed to industry. He was awarded the prestigious van Lanen Award in 2001 by the American Chemical Society and is currently the president of the International Society for Molecular Recognition. 
We thank him for his kind support to get the project going. </p>
